\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Simple rules but it takes many years of study to master
  \item
    Considered hardest classic board game and grand challenge for AI
  \item
    AlphaGo and AlphaGoZero have rocked the Go and AI world

\item
  Challenges
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Search is intractable due to enormous search space $(\sim 10^{170})$ and large number of legal move per state$(\sim 250)$
    \item
    Massive computational requirements for MCTS and training DNN
  \item
    Lack of domain expertise

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize} 
  \item
    Formulate Go as a turn-taking, two player, zero-sum game of perfect information. The input for each agent is current board positions and histories. The output (action space) is any legal position and a pass action. 
  \item
  The goal is to have agent learn to play Go without incorporating lots of heuristics and predefined patterns beyond basic Go rules
  \item
  Pachi built-in \textit{UCT} engine as our oracle which is said to achieve highest amateur expect level (KGS 7 dan) on $9 \times 9$ board.

\begin{itemize} \compresslist
  \item MCTS
    pachi uses \textbf{heavy} rollout policy, which entails rule based pattern, such as \textit{atari} and  \textit{Nakade}. Also Pachi applies heuristics based priors when expanding new node. 

  \item
    Our MCTS uses \textbf{light} rollout policy and not as strong as it could be.

  \item
    For MCTS, the number of simulations per search is important for accurate policy evaluation. We manage to run $\sim 0.5$ms per simulation. 

  \item
    Policy gradient method may converge to local optimal where $\pi_{\theta}$ almost becomes deterministic and therefore we don't explore other actions. This is particularly bad for the starting moves.

  \item
    It is computationally expensive to gather experiences through self play. It takes $>3$ hours to run 100 games with moderate 500 simulations per move.
